# PR Repo Gallery


For the precourse you completed 8+ projects from the JavaScript 30 and featured each one on your portfolio.  This means your portfolio is already pretty crowded, and we haven't even started!  This project has two main objectives:  
1. Consolidate your separate JS 30 solutions into a single landing page
2. Update your portfolio to feature only this consolidated project instead of 8 separate JS 30 Challenges.

## Resources

* Example:  [Landing Page](https://elewa-student.github.io/JS-30-Landing-Page), [Repository](https://github.com/elewa-student/JS-30-Landing-Page), [Updated Portfolio](https://elewa-student.github.io)
* [Mobirise Beginner's Guide](https://mobirise.com/help/easy-website-builder-mobirise-beginner-guide-163.html).  They say you can push your project directly to Gh-Pages, but don't bother with that.  It's glitchy.  And you'll need to save your code to your computer to write a README anyway.
* [Pigendo](https://pingendo.com) - for Linux.

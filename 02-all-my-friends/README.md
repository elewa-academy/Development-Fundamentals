# All My Friends


There's a lot of code in your future.  Keeping track of it all is no small challenge.  

In this project you build a simple repository for getting to know everyone in your study group. Along the way you will explore the project management tools provided by GitHub.

Don't worry if most of this is confusing right now.  These skills require a certain level of code maturity and development experience to master.  To help you along the way, each project in our curriculum comes with suggestions for how you can plan and track your progress.

Think of this page in the GitBook as just an introduction (for now) and a reference  (for the future).

## Specifications


Right Now:
* On your portfolio, include a link to the Projects page of your portfolio repository.  Your peers and your mentor can use this link to check up on you.
  * You will open a new gh-project in your portfolio repository for each class project.
* Complete this mini-project:
  * On your GitHub account:
    1. Open a new repository and call it something like "study-buddies".
    2. Create a project board in this repository.
    3. Invite everyone in your study group to join your project.
    4. Make 3 new columns using the available presets:
      1. _To Do_: Move all newly added issues ...
      2. _In Progress_: Move all reopened issues ...
      3. _Done_: closed issues & merged pull requests 
    5. Open & assign one new issue for each person in your study group. 
    6. Accept your study buddies' PRs as they come in, see what the board does
  * On your group mates' accounts:
    1. Be notified that you were assigned to an issue in their project.
    2. Fork their repository.
    3. Add a new markdown file to their repo
      * Named after you (name.md).
      * A short introduction to you.
      * A link to your repository.
    4. Make a pull request that links back to that issue.
      * ie. Put "#5" in your PR message.
    



Forever:
* Each time you start a project from this series, open a new Project Board on your portfolio repo.  Use _issues_ & _milestones_ to track your progress through each project and to leave notes for yourself along the way.
* Each project comes with tracking suggestions, but it's up to you to find a method that you can manage.

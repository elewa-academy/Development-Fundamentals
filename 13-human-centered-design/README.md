# Human-Centered Design

Computers run your code, developers maintain it, and humans use it.  This project focuses on the humans who use it.

You will learn about _Design Thinking_ & _User Empathy_ by designing a home page for one of your fellow classmates at a time.  The goal is not to learn new tools, not to build an impressive site, the goal is to understand your partner's needs.  The portfolio you build should represent them honestly and effectively to employers and other developers.

## Specifications

This project is a variation of the classic exercise in design thinking:  [The Wallet Challenge](https://medium.com/@erio/bringing-design-thinking-into-the-workplace-the-wallet-design-challenge-544c727d3752).  You will pair up with one other person and design a portfolio/cv to fit their needs.

There is a very specific process you should follow. The process is the project - not the finished portfolio!  You can find [a template here](https://github.com/elewa-academy/design-cycle-template).

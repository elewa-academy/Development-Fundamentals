## 1. First Interview

Take a few minutes getting to know your partner and their programming ambitions.  Ask questions about: 
* Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
* Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
* Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
* And much more!  Listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.

### Notes

Notes you took during the interview.

### Summary

Consolidate your notes into a few sentences.  Do your best to express what your partner was trying to say, not what you learned from them.

## 2. Follow-Up Interview

In this follow up interview you will present to your partner a summary of your first interview.

Update your notes accordingly

## 4. Define the Problem

In your own words describe:
1. Why your partner needs this portfolio 
2. How they want to be represented
3. How their audience will interact with the portfolio
4. What will it need to have / be like

A useful format:
> _partner's name_ needs a way to _?_.
> Unexpectedly, in their world, _?_.

## 5. Open-Ended Ideation

With no regard to your programming ability, time constraints, technical constraints, or any other practical concern sketch up a few ideas for your partner's portfolio.  Be sure to include user interactions: are there hovers? modals? parallax?


You can use Wireframe.cc, Sketchboard.io, pencile/paper/camera, ...  Just be sure to include samples of your sketches in your repository as links or embedded images.

___

## 6. Partner Feedback

Show and explain your ideas to your partner.  Carefully note their reactions and feedback.

___

## 7. Final Plan

Using your previous demos and partner feedback, write a full development plan for their portfolio.  This plan will take the same format as the _Organizing Development_ project.  Complete the [README from last project's template](https://github.com/elewa-academy/User-Centered-Template), include it in this repository, and link to it from this section.

___

## 8. Final Build

Create a mock-up of the "finished portfolio".  This will be a more detailed mock-up than you used for wireframes or your first round of ideation.  It will include color, images, and finished text.

Feel free to use your portfolio as a template, or even to build with Mobirise.  The focus of this project is your partner, not programming. 

If you did a good job, your partner will want you to replace theirs for this new one!


[TOP](#steps)

___

## 9. Final Feedback

The Design Process is never finished!

After you've finished the Final Plan & Final Build ask your partner for feedback.  In a professional setting this would be the beginning of a whole new development cycle.

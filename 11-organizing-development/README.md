# Organizing Development

The purpose of this project is to introduce you to the skills needed to plan and carry out an organized development process.

When you're just learning and still building smaller projects by yourself, it can feel like a lot of extra work to plan your projects.  Especially when you can get them done faster and better just by winging it.  But as soon as you start working with someone else or building larger projects you'll quickly find it harder to keep track of what's going on.

Software and development can get extremely complicated. It won't be long before you can't possibly keep track of everything happening in your code, no matter how good you are.  Learning to plan and organize will be 10x harder if you wait until you can't keep all of your code in mind at once.

So take some time now while you're still building simple projects to practice planning.  If you learn this now you will have the mental tools necessary to look at large projects and break them into little projects, or "sprints", in your mind.  This skill will carry you farther faster than you expect.

## Learning Objectives

The main challenge with this project is to finish one website per day.  Each site should be the most challenging site you could possibly finish in one single day's work.  Along the way you will learn about organizing your projects, estimating the scope of your project, and hopefully gain a good understanding of your level.  

Primary Learning Objectives
* Project planning & estimation
* Self-knowledge
* User-centered development

Secondary Learning Objectives
* Practice with devtools
* Building frontend fundamentals
* Git & GitHub familiarity
* Programming maturity
* Monkey Testing
* Git Feature Releases

## Requirements


Complete at least 5 User Centered [template repos](https://github.com/elewa-academy/User-Centered-Template/blob/master/README.md), build a gallery landing page to feature them all, and include this landing page on your portfolio.

When you're building your pages remember that the purpose of these projects is to __organize__ and __estimate__ their development cycle.   Don't worry about making your websites super pretty, about using cool libraries, or having awesome features.  You should even consider not using any JS or jQuery in your sites at all!  Always choose the simplest possible implementation so you can focus on the development _process_.

After you've planned your development cycle, you'll end up with an ordered list of features that you will implement one at a time.  You will only start the next feature _after_ the previous one is entirely functional.  Each feature is a __release__.  Releases allow you to provide a stable product as frequently as possible, even before every functionality is present.  Each time you complete a feature, you will mark it with a Version tag.  This makes it easy for you to access old working versions of the website if something goes wrong.

For more detailed instructions on how to structure your development process you can read through the [template repo](https://github.com/elewa-academy/User-Centered-Template/).

Challenge:
* Don't just tag versions, [develop on branches](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)!
